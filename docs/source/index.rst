Welcome to Soundatron's documentation!
======================================


Welcome Soundatron's documentation.


Soundatron is a small flask app that helps you configure your bit perfect MPD server. Soundatron is targeted at little arm computers like the `RaspberyPi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ and `BeagleBone Black <http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black>`_ boards, but will probably run on anything that meets the requirements.

Soundatron has been tested on the following device OS combos:

1. Beaglebone Black - `Debian Wheezy 7.4 <http://beagleboard.org/latest-images>`_
2. Raspberry PI - `Raspian <http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/>`_
3. And my laptop, a Lenovo E220s - Ubuntu 13.10

Soundatron works because `mpd-configure <https://github.com/ronalde/mpd-configure>`_ works. Check it out.
