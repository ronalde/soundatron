What does Soundatron do?
============================

Not much! and that's the way we like it. 

Soundatron does two things:

1. It allows you to configure a small subset of MPD settings.

- Sound device
- Music directory
- Zeroconf Name

2. It creates and applies a new mpd.conf with settings that enable your device to be a bit perfect music server.

What it isn't...
===========================

1. It isn't a MPD client. You will stell need one those to use your server. `Link` <http://www.musicpd.org/clients/>`_
2. It isn't ready for prime time. Don't run this on a machine that has anything on it that you love or hold dear.
3. It isn't secure. Soundatron does some pretty funny stuff with your password right now. Only use it behind a firewall and don't tell anyone about it.
